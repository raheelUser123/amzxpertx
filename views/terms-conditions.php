                            and does not create a business or professional services relationship between us. A service
                            relationship may be established when you place a request for the Services through the Site

                        <li>We reserve the right to undertake all necessary steps to ensure that the security, safety,
                            and integrity of our systems as well as its users' interests are and remain, well–protected.

                    </ul>
                    <h4>Fees and Invoicing</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We will issue you a valid tax invoice in respect of each service. We will notify you as soon
                            as the deliverable is ready for download. You will be required to pay all fees before
                            downloading of the deliverable. Except as specified herein or in the Order Form (i) fees are
                            based on the Services requested / purchased and not actual usage, (ii) payment obligations
                            are non-cancellable and fees are non-refundable.</li>
                        <li>Payment shall be made: (a) in full without set-off, counterclaim or withholding of any kind
                            (save where and to the extent that this cannot by law be excluded); and (b) in the currency
                            mentioned in the order confirmation.</li>
                        <li>You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to
                            us and notifying us of any changes to such information</li>
                        <li>We will re-issue any invoice if any error is later discovered. If you have overpaid as a
                            result of a billing error, your account will be credited with the overpayment or, if you
                            have stopped acquiring the Service from us, we will refund the overpayment promptly after
                            your request and after deduction of any other amounts due by you to us.</li>
                        <li>Billing Dispute: You may dispute an amount invoiced by us but only if you do so in
                            accordance with this clause:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Except to the extent you raise a valid billing dispute in respect of our invoice,
                                    you agree that the invoice is valid and payable (and you must pay any undisputed
                                    amount included in the invoice in accordance with this clause "Fees and Invoicing”)
                                </li>
                                <li>To raise a valid billing dispute, you must (i) make a good faith request to us to
                                    investigate the specific charges or invoice, providing at the same time specific
                                    evidence which demonstrates that a particular charge or invoice is incorrect; and
                                    (ii) make any such request to us within 1 month of the date of the relevant invoice.
                                </li>

                                    which are reasonably necessary and appropriate in the circumstances of the dispute.
                                    At the end of these investigations, you will pay any outstanding amount within five
                                    Business Days.</li>
                            </ul>

                    <h4>Refunds/Cancellation Policy</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Please be notified that we do not entertain refund requests if you change your mind. Once an
                            order is delivered you are no longer eligible to ask for a 100% refund. Once an order has
                            been started, the hours put into the project cannot be recuperated and thus we will not
                            provide a refund. The Products and Services offered are non-refundable and come with no
                            warranties, expressed or implied. However, you may ask for up to three revisions free of
                            charge. In case you are not 100% satisfied with the quality of the product/ services, you
                            may ask for a 50% refund against the paid fee amount.</li>
                        <li>We will process the refund of the 50% fee amount subject to verification of the quality
                            concerns you would claim. In case you have a special complaint scenario and demand a full
                            fee amount refund then your case shall be forwarded to the evaluation committee and they
                            will take an impartial decision based upon facts and shreds of evidence.</li>
                        <li>Please be notified that you are NOT eligible for a 100% refund once an order is completed
                            and delivered. You may request three revisions in total if the provided product or service
                            does not meet your expectations/ project requirements. You may file a partial refund request
                            if ONLY we have your feedback in written communication followed by disapproved revisions
                            from your end. If you fail to produce any such communication trail, we won't entertain any
                            refund claims.</li>
                        <li>In case a customer submits a charge-back without approaching Ecommonks for a refund
                            or to discuss the case with the Account Manager, the customer will become ineligible for a
                            refund after that, and Ecommonks reserves the right to not entertain the refund
                            request.</li>
                        <li> is not responsible for a refund, if the client’s preferred journal choice rejects his/ her
                            submission. In instances where the journal rejects the paper, for any reason whatsoever, be
                            it, plagiarism, formatting, journal will not be accountable for a full refund.</li>
                        <li>No cancellation requests will be accepted for confirmed orders.</li>
                    </ul>
